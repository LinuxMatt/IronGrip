WHAT IS LIBCDDB

Libcddb is a library that implements the different protocols (CDDBP,
HTTP, SMTP) to access data on a CDDB server (http://freedb.org).  It
tries to be as cross-platform as possible.  The initial libary will
have a C API.


DOCUMENTATION

The API documentation can be consulted on the project homepage:
    http://libcddb.sourceforge.net/

It is possible to create your own copy of this documentation in both
HTML and LaTeX format using the doxygen program (http://doxygen.org).
If you have doxygen installed, execute the following command in the
doc/ directory:
    doxygen doxygen.conf

This will create two subdirectories html/ and latex/ in which you will
find the documentation in the respective formats.


COMPILING

See INSTALL for instructions.


TESTING

The regression tests also test the networking code.  For all these
tests to complete successfully, you will need an Internet connection.
The FreeDB server at www.freedb.org needs to be accessible on both
ports 888 (CDDBP protocol) and 80 (HTTP protocol).  The test also
includes code to verify the proxy functionality.  These tests can only
succeed when the 'http_proxy' enviroment variable is defined.  Set
this variable with a statement similar as the one below:

    export http_proxy='http://proxy:80'

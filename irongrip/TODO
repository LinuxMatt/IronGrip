TODO
====

Higher priority:
----------------
* fix flac output analysis, percentage scanning is not always accurate
* use --best for flac compression (-8 is equivalent)
* fix encoding failures with flac
* fix sigchld for flac
* .cddbslave multiple matches not working (bug in libcddb)
* when cdrom drive is changed in preferences, scan again asap

Normal priority:
---------------
* Find help to make packages for many Linux distributions (Fedora, Slackware...)
* Find help to translate irongrip
* Replace maintainer-build.sh with autogen.sh
* Add support for OGG Vorbis
* Add support for libmusicbrainz
* Add option named Cdparanoia fast mode (-Z)

Lower priority:
---------------
* Enable logging on console (stderr)
* Fix log output format
* Fix GTK+ requirement in doc and configure.ac
  - IronGrip does not compile on Slackware 10.2 because GTK+ is too old (2.6.10).
  - irongrip seems to require at least GTK+ v2.8
  - gtk_entry_completion_set_popup_set_width () requires GTK+ 2.8

Done in next branch
-------------------
* Add option to "Always overwrite files"
* Add AM_SILENT_RULES([yes])
* log filename is /tmp/irongrip.$USER.log

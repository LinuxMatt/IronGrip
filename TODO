TODO
====

Higher priority:
----------------
* make binary .deb packages for Ubuntu LTS versions.
* .cddbslave multiple matches not working (maybe a bug in libcddb)
* 'eject disc' doesn't work on Ubuntu, try "/usr/bin/eject".

Normal priority:
---------------
* Find help to make packages for many Linux distributions (Fedora, Slackware...)
* Find help to translate irongrip

Lower priority:
---------------
* Enable logging on console (stderr)
* Fix log output format
* Fix GTK+ requirement in doc and configure.ac
  - IronGrip does not compile on Slackware 10.2 because GTK+ is too old (2.6.10).
  - irongrip seems to require at least GTK+ v2.8
  - gtk_entry_completion_set_popup_set_width () requires GTK+ 2.8

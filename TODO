TODO
====

* make install
* 'eject disc' doesn't work.
* Enable logging on console (stderr)
* Fix log output format

* Fix GTK+ requirement in doc and configure.ac
  - IronGrip does not compile on Slackware 10.2 because GTK+ is too old (2.6.10).
  - irongrip seems to require at least GTK+ v2.8
  - gtk_entry_completion_set_popup_set_width () requires GTK+ 2.8
